# TTN-Apeldoorn P1-Node board and housing
The P1-Node is designed with reproduction in mind. Therefore the PCB was desigened using <a href="https://kicad-pcb.org/" target="_blank">KiCad</a>. In addition the PCB was designed with an introduction to SMD soldering in mind. Components are chosen to be "big" so they can be hand-soldered or using reflow techniques. The housing can be finished using basic drill techniques and some parts are 3D-printed.

## repository content
The hardware part of the repository has 3 folders:

   1. Documentation
   2. Board (esp32-p1-node-board)
   3. Housing (esp32-p1-node-housing)

### Documentation
This folder contains relevant documentation, datasheets and links to topics that are relevant for the project.

### Board (esp32-p1-node-board)
This folder contains the complete PCB design and libraries for the P1-Node for <a href="https://kicad-pcb.org/" target="_blank">KiCad</a>.

### Housing (esp32-p1-node-housing)
This ![folder](esp32-p1-node-housing/ "folder")folder contains both the source of the 3D printed frame as well as the .stl file for printing it. Also the measures for teh holes that shall be made in the ABS housing arde documented here.
